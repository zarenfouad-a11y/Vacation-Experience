    <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
    <p>
      For my vacation, I went to <strong>Pier 35 in New York City</strong>, a beautiful spot along the East River
      with a modern park and an incredible skyline. From the pier you can see the <em>Manhattan Bridge</em>, the
      <em>Brooklyn Bridge</em>, and sparkling city views. I spent time enjoying the water, relaxing on benches,
      and breathing the fresh air. Pier 35 felt peaceful yet lively—a perfect place for sightseeing and unwinding.

    <h2>What would you do?</h2>
    <p>
      I kept the trip active and fun. I played <strong>basketball</strong> near the pier and went to the
      <strong>gym</strong> for a good workout. I visited a <strong>secret scenic spot</strong> with peaceful
      bridge and river views, then spent time in a nearby park to sit, talk, and play <strong>football</strong>
      with friends. Here’s my quick activity list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Play basketball by the pier</li>
      <li>Exercise at the gym</li>
      <li>Visit a secret scenic viewing point</li>
      <li>Relax at the park and play football</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
    <p>
      After walking and sports, I was excited for food. I had a tasty <strong>Texas-style chicken &amp; burger
      sandwich</strong>—flavorful and filling. New York brings together foods from all over the U.S. and the world,
      so grabbing this bold, comforting sandwich felt just right. Eating in the park with friends made the day feel
      cozy and memorable.
